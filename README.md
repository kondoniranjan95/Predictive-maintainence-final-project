# Predictive Maintainence
### Problem: To predict the failure of the process based on its process parameters
### Data: The dataset consists of 8648 counts for various processes with 31 different process parameters like the 3D position, voltage, current, noise,vibrations, temperature, luminosity, forces, process and preparation time. Data source https://bigml.com/dashboard/dataset/61ae537d8be2aa1885005c8b
### Methodology: Python and Tableau are the primary tools for the data analysis and visualization. Morever, Trello and Git shall be used for Project planning and management.
### Major milestones:
#### 1. Defining the objective 
#### 2. Data gathering and study
#### 3. Data cleaning and wrangling 
#### 4. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
#### 5. Machine learning models application and finalizing the model
#### 6. Iterate untill acceptable model is built
#### 7. Presentation preparation
